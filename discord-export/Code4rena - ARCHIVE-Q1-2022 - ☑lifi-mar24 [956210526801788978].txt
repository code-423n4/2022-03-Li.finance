@üê∫wardens We needed to update the naming of the LI.FI repo URLs as it was causing an issue with our findings form.  

The new repo link to view code and documentation is: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance

Anyone else having issues running the tests locally? Getting an issue related to the mainnet forking: `Error: Trying to initialize a provider with block 25689963 but the current block is 1445218`


[03/25/2022 12:29 AM] _t1nt1n
jk, got it


[03/25/2022 11:43 AM] aga7hokakological
some transactions are passing but I am too getting same kind of error any help


[03/25/2022 11:49 AM] max_lifi
The polygon RPCs are not very stable which sometimes makes it hard for hardhat to load the required state. We are forking the chain in the tests because we need a valid state of the bridges we are calling. It may help to execute only single tests or remove the `--bail`  flag from the test command to not stop as soon as one test fails.


[03/25/2022 11:56 AM] caventa
I face a lot of problems when running yarn run test. I would advise there are more documentation written on how to fix the problem


[03/25/2022 12:18 PM] _t1nt1n
I'm using alchemy for all three rpc urls (mainent, rinkeby, polygon) if that helps


[03/25/2022 12:18 PM] _t1nt1n
@caventa ^ maybe this will help you too


[03/25/2022 12:27 PM] caventa
Can I see your env file?


[03/25/2022 12:28 PM] _t1nt1n

Hi, I am confused by this in the README 
> We are planning to to improve the LibSwap libraries to not only check the exchange calls using a contract address whitelist, but also use a function signature whitelist to ensure that only known functions are called in those contracts.
does this mean we should not submit exploits related to this?


[03/28/2022 12:47 PM] max_lifi
Please feel free to submit related exploits, we want to verify that this addition would really help and is needed.

[03/28/2022 7:01 PM] pedroais
Nope doesn't work for me either


[03/28/2022 7:01 PM] pedroais
Guess it's my problem


[03/28/2022 7:01 PM] pedroais
Thanks


[03/28/2022 7:03 PM] pedroais
It's weird I can load the li.fi site but not the documentation


[03/28/2022 7:21 PM] max_lifi
Works for me as well.


[03/29/2022 4:17 PM] pedroais
Hey where can I find documentation for the anyswap router ?


[03/29/2022 4:22 PM] max_lifi
The anyswap (multichain) documentation is pretty limited. You can find some info in their docs which also links to their github:

[03/29/2022 4:23 PM] pedroais
Thanks


[03/29/2022 4:24 PM] pedroais
There's nothing there about the functions


[03/29/2022 4:24 PM] pedroais
So if i want to know what anySwapOutNative does for example I guess I need to read the code on etherscan ?


[03/29/2022 4:24 PM] pedroais
How did you do this ?


[03/29/2022 4:35 PM] max_lifi
We are in contact with the developers of all the bridges we integrate and get direct support from them. And for sure we also check their UI interfaces and how they interact with their contracts and the contracts themself.


[03/29/2022 4:36 PM] pedroais
Okay, thank you
